## Current Rover: 2025 URC SAR

Our latest rover was developed for the URC SAR 2025 competition, featuring:

- **Communication & Positioning**: Low-latency protocols with centimeter-level accuracy
- **Autonomy & Mission Performance**: Advanced SLAM with real-time 3D mapping
- **Modular Architecture**: Science and manipulator modules for versatile missions

Although we did not qualify for the final round, the insights gained from design, simulation, and field testing have been invaluable for our next challenge.
