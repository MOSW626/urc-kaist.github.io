# University Rover Challenge (URC)

## What is URC?

The **University Rover Challenge (URC)** is the world's premier robotics competition for college students. Held annually in the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) in Utah, USA, URC challenges teams to design and build the next generation of Mars rovers.

## Competition Overview

URC consists of four main mission tasks:

### 1. Science Mission
- Autonomous sample collection and analysis
- Life detection experiments
- Geological surveying

### 2. Extreme Retrieval and Delivery
- Navigation through rough terrain
- Object manipulation and transport
- Autonomous pathfinding

### 3. Equipment Servicing
- Tool manipulation and repair tasks
- Precise positioning and control
- Mechanical system operations

### 4. Autonomous Traversal
- GPS-denied navigation
- Obstacle avoidance
- Path planning and execution

## Our Participation

URC-KAIST has been participating in URC since [YEAR], consistently pushing the boundaries of autonomous robotics technology. Our team focuses on:

- **Advanced SLAM algorithms** for precise navigation
- **Modular design** for quick mission adaptation
- **Robust communication systems** for reliable operation
- **Innovative science payloads** for research missions
